        <p>My name is Mallory Ebengho, originally from Africa, where 'The Rumble in the Jungle' took place on
            <b>October October 30, 1974</b>, in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo).
            I speak French, Lingala and English, but there's a language that I lost which is continue to be my regret as a kid. 
            
        </p>

        <p>My family and I were blessed enough to come in the US as immagrants via DV Lottery played around the world.
            Four years on the road, I met my fabulous and crazy wife depending on her mood then moved together struggle and grow old together.
            Later became blessed with a son, who is the first grandchild, currently two years since 16th of November.
            Ryllon is our motivation to better ourselves than educate him so that he can grow having a wonderful life.
        </p>

        <p>My wife, Kerene, and I went to Cancun as a suprise gift for my birthday, so all these beautiful pictures happen to be due to her.
            The other person in skyblue shirt is my little brother, Samuel, who is the tallest in the family. I'll update the pictures
            of my wife and kid. I don't have any picture in this PC. 
        </p>
